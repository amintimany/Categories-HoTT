*) The following are commented. They should be changed to be provable. We should either define a special type for isomorphism of categories
or prove define these for the spcial case of Cat (now only of categories whose objects form an HSet).

-- IsoCat_NatTrans
-- IsoCat_NatTrans_back
-- Func_Cat_Op_Iso
-- Discr_Cat_Dual_Iso
-- Discr_Cat_Iso
-- Cat_Iso.v (the whole file)
-- Comma_Opposite_Iso
-- Comma_Right_Func_Iso
-- Hom_Func_to_Iso_Hom_Func

*) Functor_Image must be changed so that the criterion for homomorphisms is an HProp. This can be done by truncating the Forall_Links part to HProp.

*) Type Type_n can't be immediately defined as < on natural numbers is not defined. Similarly for Finite in Car_Restrictions.v.

*)  The following use or rely on JMeq_eq and may not be directly provable:

-- Comma_Left_Func_Iso_FC_Iso
